# Anomaly-Detection
 The system is designed to help financial institutions and businesses detect fraudulent activities in real-time.

Project Title: Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions
Description:
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in financial datasets using machine learning-based anomaly detection techniques. It leverages unsupervised and semi-supervised learning approaches to identify unusual patterns in transaction data. The system is designed to help financial institutions and businesses detect fraudulent activities in real-time.

Key Features:
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Identifies patterns, trends, and correlations in transaction data.
âœ… Anomaly Detection Models â€“ Implements KNN, DBSCAN, and Isolation Forest to detect outliers.
âœ… Feature Engineering â€“ Utilizes time-series features, transaction history, and customer behavior for better accuracy.
âœ… Model Evaluation â€“ Uses precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC to assess model performance.
âœ… Scalability & Deployment â€“ Supports real-time fraud detection with model deployment via Flask/FastAPI.
âœ… Visualization & Insights â€“ Generates reports and visualizations to interpret detected anomalies.

Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data handling & preprocessing
Scikit-learn, XGBoost â€“ Machine learning model training
DBSCAN, KNN, Isolation Forest â€“ Anomaly detection algorithms
Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ Data visualization
Flask / FastAPI â€“ API for real-time fraud detection
SQL / NoSQL Databases â€“ Data storage and retrieval
